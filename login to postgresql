To log into postgresql, you need to use postgres user, however, it failed when I run the following command:

root@cenos7-rock#psql -h localhost -U postgres

psql:FATAL: Ident authentication failed for user "postgres"

To fix it, run the following commands:
root@cenos7-rock#su postgres
It will enter into postgres shell command, then run 

bash-4.2$ psql
